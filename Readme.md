This project is aimed to find out the efficiency of bandit algorithms to detect anomalies in computer networks.


Bandit algorithms have been useful in finding optimal actions to be taken under the given context in medical field where positive reward is awarded if the agent chooses the right dose of medicine and is penalized with negative reward if it chooses the wrong action(arm)

Similar to patients having some kind of context which help MAB agents to choose right arm in the long run, we decided to test its effectiveness in correctly identifying the network attack type as network also have context attached with it
